### Guidelines for first time contributors

* https://github.com/Roshanjossey/first-contributions

* **Don't stretch**. If you complete an issue in long time, there is a possibility that other developers finish their part and you face code conflicts which may increase code complexity for you. So it is always good to complete an issue ASAP. 
* Please refrain to work on multiple issues marked with "first-timers-only" in the same repo. Ask and help your friends and colleagues to attempt rest issues.
* Please claim the issue and clear your doubts before raising PR. So other users will not start working on the same issue.
* Mention the issue number either in PR detail or in commit message.
* Keep increasing the level of challenge.
* Don't hesitate to question on github issue or on twitter.
